   - Error handling and user confirmation flows

3. **Form Improvements**: Implement new UI components

   - Replace existing pickers with @react-native-picker/picker
   - Integrate keyboard-aware scroll view in forms
   - Improve overall form user experience

4. **Test Implementation**: Write comprehensive tests for core functionality

   - i18n translation utilities tests
   - Edge function integration tests
   - Achievement system tests (including new milestone logic)
   - Store review integration tests
   - Updated modal system tests

### Medium Priority

1. **Advanced Testing**: E2E testing setup and performance benchmarks
