## Completed Focus Areas

### Focus Area 1: Basic Habit Tracking

- **What Works:**
  - Users can create, edit, and delete habits.
  - Habit completion can be tracked daily.
  - Basic UI for listing habits and marking them complete.
- **What's Left:**
  - More advanced tracking options (e.g., specific days, frequency).

### Focus Area 2: User Authentication

- **What Works:**
  - Email/password signup and login.
  - Google and Apple social logins.
  - Secure session management.
- **What's Left:**
  - Password reset functionality.

### Focus Area 3: Streaks and Achievements

- **What Works:**
  - Calculation of current and max streaks.
  - Basic achievement system for hitting streak milestones (e.g., 3-day, 7-day).
  - `user_achievements` table stores streak data and achievements.
- **What's Left:**
  - More diverse achievements beyond just streaks.
  - UI for displaying achievements to the user.

### Focus Area 4: Notification System (Phase 1 & Edge Function Updates)

- **What Works:**
  - **User Profile Preferences:**
    - `users` table in Supabase now has `allow_streak_notifications` and `allow_daily_update_notifications` (both `BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE`).
    - `UserProfile` type in `lib/stores/user_profile.ts` updated to include these fields.
    - `useUserProfileStore` manages these preferences, with optimistic local updates and background synchronization to Supabase.
  - **State Management:**
    - `useAppStore` (`lib/stores/app_state.ts`) simplified to only manage the master `notificationsEnabled` toggle for device-level registration.
    - Specific notification preferences (`allow_streak_notifications`, `allow_daily_update_notifications`) are handled by `useUserProfileStore`.
  - **Onboarding Flow:**
    - `OnboardingSignUp.tsx` correctly initializes new users with default notification preferences in Supabase.
    - `OnboardingLogin.tsx` uses store methods (`setProfile`, `completeOnboarding`) to ensure user data (including notification preferences) is correctly handled and synced upon login.
  - **Edge Function Filtering:**
    - `daily-update-note` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/daily-update-note/`) now filters users based on `allow_daily_update_notifications` being `true`.
    - `streak-note` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/streak-note/`) now filters users based on `allow_streak_notifications` being `true`.
    - `streak-note` utils refactored to centralize streak calculation and correctly use notification templates.
  - **Supabase Types:** `supabase/types.ts` updated to reflect new columns in the `users` table.
- \*\*What's Left (for full notification system - subsequent phases):
  - **Phase 2: UI Integration:** Update `app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx` to allow users to toggle these new notification preferences, linking UI switches to `useUserProfileStore` actions.
  - **Phase 3: Backend Logic Refinement (Post-UI):** Ensure Edge Functions correctly use the preferences when preparing and sending actual push notifications (not just scheduling in DB).
  - **Phase 4: Data Migration (if needed for existing users):** Decide on and implement a strategy for existing users (e.g., default to `true` or `false`, or prompt them).
  - Thorough end-to-end testing of the notification lifecycle.

## Current Status

- The core features for habit tracking, user authentication, basic streaks, and foundational notification preferences are in place.
- The system for managing user-specific notification settings (`allow_streak_notifications`, `allow_daily_update_notifications`) is implemented in the user profile store and Supabase.
- Edge functions for daily updates and streak notifications now respect these user preferences.
- Next steps involve integrating these preferences into the settings UI.

## Known Issues

- Password reset is not yet implemented.
- Achievement system is basic; needs more variety and UI representation.
- Full end-to-end notification delivery and UI toggles for preferences are pending completion of subsequent phases for the notification system.
- The `syncWithSupabase` function in `lib/stores/user_profile.ts` had its `Toast.show` call removed from the `catch` block, meaning UI feedback for sync failures is currently not implemented there (this might be intentional, to be handled at the component level, but worth noting).
