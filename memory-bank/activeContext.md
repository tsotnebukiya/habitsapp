# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently in its initial setup phase with the following areas of focus:

1. **Core Infrastructure**

   - Basic project structure established
   - Core dependencies installed
   - Development environment setup
   - Sync mechanism implemented

2. **Authentication System**

   - Multiple provider integration pending
   - Token management implementation needed
   - User flow design in progress

3. **State Management**
   - Zustand stores setup
   - MMKV integration complete
   - Type definitions in progress
   - Offline-first sync pattern established

## Recent Changes

1. Project initialization with Expo
2. Basic directory structure setup
3. Core dependencies installation
4. Initial documentation creation
5. Implemented habits interface with offline sync
6. Added sync initialization in app layout
7. Setup periodic sync in home tab

## Active Decisions

### Authentication Implementation

- Decision to use multiple auth providers (Apple, Google)
- Token-based authentication approach
- Secure storage strategy with MMKV

### State Management

- Zustand chosen for global state
- MMKV for performance-critical data
- AsyncStorage for larger datasets
- Offline-first architecture with optimistic updates
- Sync strategy with pending operations

### Navigation

- Expo Router v3 implementation
- File-based routing structure
- Deep linking support planning

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete authentication system implementation
2. Finalize state management type definitions
3. Set up PostHog analytics
4. Configure Sentry error tracking
5. Test sync mechanism with poor network conditions

### Upcoming Work

1. UI component library development
2. Testing infrastructure setup
3. Documentation expansion
4. Performance optimization

## Known Issues

1. Environment variable setup pending
2. Authentication flow incomplete
3. Type definitions need refinement
4. Testing infrastructure not configured

## Current Considerations

1. **Performance**

   - Bundle size optimization needed
   - Animation performance tuning required
   - List rendering optimization pending
   - Sync performance monitoring needed

2. **Security**

   - Token management implementation
   - Secure storage setup
   - API security configuration
   - Data encryption during sync

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Documentation improvements needed
   - Development workflow optimization
   - Testing strategy implementation
   - Sync debugging tools needed

## Questions to Resolve

1. âœ… Best practices for offline data sync
2. Authentication flow edge cases
3. State persistence strategy
4. Performance optimization approach
5. Sync conflict resolution edge cases
